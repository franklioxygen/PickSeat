*Real-time Reserved Seating Chart*

Users can access a web app and see a grid of circles, representing stadium seats.  They can select up to 10 seats from the grid. Other users visiting the app can see the seats update in real-time, as selections are made. If the user exhausts their 10 seats, they have to click on their selected seats to deselect them. Others can't reserve a seat that's already selected.
